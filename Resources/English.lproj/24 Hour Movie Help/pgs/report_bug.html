						<p class="Para">The Twenty-Four Hour Movie is never intentionally released with significant bugs, although occasionally we may elect to release the product with minor bugs. <a href="help:anchor='known_bugs' bookID=24 Hour Movie Help">View a list of bugs we already know about.</a></p>
						<p class="Para">If you find a bug or other unexpected behavior in The Twenty-Four Hour Movie, you can report it to us by following the steps below. Please provide as much information as you feel might be helpful. If you are familiar with Mac OS X applications like Console, information from those utilities can also be helpful.</p>
						<p class="Para">If The Twenty-Four Hour Movie crashes, Finder will display a dialog allowing you to report the crash. Unfortunately, this reports the crash to Apple, not to us, so it doesn&rsquo;t do us very much good. You can, however, still get us the information, by following the steps below, once the crash notification dialog appears.</p>
